## Image Super-resolution with ruDALL-E

This is a Cog implementation of the [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) super-resolution model from [ruDALL-E](https://github.com/sberbank-ai/ru-dalle). View Replicate demo [here](https://replicate.ai/cjwbw/rudalle-sr).

Real-ESRGAN was created by Xintao Wang, Liangbin Xie, Chao Dong, and Ying Shan. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10833.pdf). \
[Re-trained version of Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/boomb0om/Real-ESRGAN-colab) was created by Igor Pavlov
ruDALL-E was created by Alex Shonenkov, Tatiana Shavrina, et al., at Sberbank AI.
